Thanks for visiting pyPRML blog site.

This project is dedicated to implement a python lib for C.M.Bishop's PRML. And in order to display and implement the vision of PRML examples, we choose iPython for convenient expression and teaching purpose. 

Bayesian method is the main and powerful way in this masterpiece, it's interesting to exploring more aspects of these work, especially under current Deep Learning(DL) main stream. Machine learning, or the more extended field AI, is not only about DL. Lots of algorithms can be more efficient and succinct in different fields, which is depend on the domain youâ€™re in. And Bayesian method is one kind of nature approach of statistics to hack the problems in real life. Of course, nobody knows which way is correct or better for future. But at least, we need to give every fields one tunnel for further exploring.
